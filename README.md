## About
Modern-day communication is more and more reliant on smartphones. This can cause issues in numerous situations. It can alienate people with writing, seeing, or technological deficiencies. 

Since the development of new electronic systems is often too complicated for non-affine people, the goal is to develop a platform that makes it easier to get started with such a project. The highest priority was given to audio input and output, user differentiation/management, file saving, and transferring those wirelessly.
