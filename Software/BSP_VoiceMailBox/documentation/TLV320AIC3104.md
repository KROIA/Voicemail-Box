## Features
This codec is very complex and features much more than needed for the Voice Mail Box.
The most features are therefore not implemented into the class for easy usage.
The following features are implemented so far:
- Starting and stopping of the I2S DMA
- Easy access to the microphone and speaker data arrays.
- Performance benchmarking for checking audio processing time vs DMA time
- Setting the microphone gain in dB
