# I2C
This class is a simplfied interface to access the i2c peripheral.
Only basic functions, which are used in the project, are implemented.
The implementation does not use DMA, it is designed to be blocking.

## Features
- Writing one byte to a specific 8bit register on a I2C device.
- Reading one byte from a specifc 8bit register on a I2C device.

---
## Setup    
- Inside CubeMX, configure your i2c interface.
- Start the code generation and open the code editor.

---
## Usage
CubeMX generates a **I2C_HandleTypeDef** instance in the **main.c**
The **I2C** class needs access to that handle. Since the C++ code can't be used directly in the **main.c**, another way of getting to the handle is needed.
Make sure the C++ application is setup, you can find the instructions on how to do so [here](CppFromC.md).

#### Modify main.h and main.c
In the **main.h** create a get function that returns a pointer to the handle we want.
``` C
// main.h

// Function declaration
I2C_HandleTypeDef* getI2C_handle();
```

``` C
// main.c

/* Private variables generated by CubeMX */
I2C_HandleTypeDef hi2c1;

/* USER CODE BEGIN PV */
// Function implementation
I2C_HandleTypeDef* getI2C_handle()
{
    // Return the pointer to the handle
    return &hi2c1;
}
/* USER CODE END PV */
```

#### Inside the C++ Application
``` C++ 
// Application.cpp
#include "BSP_VoiceMailBox.hpp" // includes "peripherals/i2c.hpp"
#include "main.h" // Is needed to access the handle get function

// using a namespace globaly is not recommended for production
// but it simplyfies the example here
using namespace VoiceMailBox; 

// Create a I2C object and providing the handle from the main.c
I2C i2c(getI2C_handle());

// Called periodically
void loop()
{
    uint8_t deviceAddress = 0x05; // Use the address of your I2C target
    uint8_t registerAddress = 0x00; // Use the register address you want to read/write to, 
                                    // inside the target.
    uint8_t dataToWrite = 0x01;

    // Writes the value 0x01 to the register 0x00 on the device 0x05.
    i2c.writeRegister(deviceAddress, registerAddress, dataToWrite);

    // Reads the register 0x00 from the device 0x05 and
    // stores the value in the <readData> variable
    uint8_t readData;
    i2c.readRegister(deviceAddress, registerAddress, readData);
}
```
