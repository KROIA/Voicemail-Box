## NFC
Demo Application from ST connected using CUBE/XCUBE.\
Example uses HW components NUCLEO-H755 & X-NUCLEO-nfc08a1
- (If you want to make your own version, do not use a Nucleo project for project creation, use the microcontroller standalone instead)
- you will need to create your own pinout

## Micro SD
Demo Application from ST connected using CUBE.\
Example uses HW components NUCLEO-H755 & PMODMICROSD
- (If you want to make your own version, do not use a Nucleo project for project creation, use the microcontroller standalone instead)
- you will need to create your own pinout
